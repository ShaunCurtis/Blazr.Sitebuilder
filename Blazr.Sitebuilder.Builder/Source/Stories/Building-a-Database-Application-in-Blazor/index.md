This is a series of articles describing my Blazor Development Framework.

There are 5 articles describing various aspects of the framework and coding patterns used:

1. [Project Structure and Framework - a bit of an introduction](./Building-a-Database-Application-in-Blazor-Part-1.html).
2. [Services - Building CRUD Data Layers](./Building-a-Database-Application-in-Blazor-Part-2.html).
3. [View Components - CRUD Edit and View Operations in the UI](./Building-a-Database-Application-in-Blazor-Part-3.html).
4. [UI Components - Building HTML/CSS Controls](Building-a-Database-Application-in-Blazor-Part-4.html).
5. [View Components - CRUD List Operations in the UI](Building-a-Database-Application-in-Blazor-Part-5.html).

The articles have changed drastically since their original release:

1. The whole framework is less opinionated.  I've dropped many of the more radical approaches to some issues in Blazor/SPAs.
2. The libraries have been re-organised as my understanding has grown on how to make Server and WASM projects co-exist.
2. Everything has been updated to Net5.
3. The Repo home has moved.
5. Server and WASM SPAs are now hosted and run from the same site.
   
They are not:
1. An attempt to define best practice.
2. The finished product.
